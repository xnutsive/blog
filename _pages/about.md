Hey, I'm Nate. I'm an [Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com), we build software products.
I've also co-founded [Amplifr](https://amplifr.com), and I'm curious about applied deep learning, and deep learning research.

This blog is my attempt to not learn not only by reading and building, but also by explaining and sharing what I've built.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
