<p>DVC is the <em>git for data in ML</em> tool. It makes it easy to track and link any changes in your dataset, pipelines, model params and metrics with your git history, while not putting the whole dataset in your git repo. It's an open source alternative to Weights &amp; Biases and MLFlow that is, I might be biased here, more flexible.</p>
<p>It's fairly easy to install it and get started: you can <code>brew install dvc</code> or <code>pip install dvc</code>, setup what is called a <code>dvc remote</code> and start pushing stuff.</p>
<p>This article covers the <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/start">Getting Started guide</a> step by step, and describes the new features that has been just <a href="https://dvc.org/blog/dvc-1-0-release">recently shipped in DVC 1.0</a>.</p>
